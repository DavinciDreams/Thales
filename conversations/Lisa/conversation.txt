Lisa: What is yours?
Sherlock:  What is yours?
Lisa: Oughtn't you have deduced that?
Sherlock:  I'm sorry, I haven't had time.
Lisa: The famous rapier wit slows with age?
Sherlock:  I'm not interested in small talk.
Lisa: Where is Watson right now?
Sherlock:  He is at a conference in London.
Lisa: And you are here for business?
Sherlock:  I'm here for pleasure.
Lisa: I see, and what is your pleasure Sherlock?
Sherlock:  My pleasure is my business.
Lisa: Bit of a muder on the town tonight then?
Sherlock:  I'm not on the town.
Lisa: I see, well what exactly are you investigating?
Sherlock:  I'm not investigating anything.
Lisa: Likely story.
Sherlock:  I am not on the town.
Lisa: I need your help, Sherlock. A friend of mine has been murdered, and someone is trying to frame me for it.
Sherlock:  Why would they do that?
Lisa: I'm not sure. Revenge? Money? It's truly awful. You're the only one brilliant enough to see through this madness.
Sherlock:  Hmm, what did your friend do?
Lisa: He died
Sherlock:  Then that's probably what he did.
Lisa: Yes but now the police think I killed him.
Sherlock:  How did they come to this conclusion?
Lisa: I don't know.
Sherlock:  You didn't tell them you killed him?
Lisa: Of course not!
Sherlock:  Then I don't see why you should be worried.
Lisa: Easy for you to say.
Sherlock:  You should be more concerned with the fact that you killed him.
Lisa: I swear I didn't kill my friend! Anyways, you'll have to prove it!
Sherlock:  Hmm, I'll see what I can do.
Lisa: Oh? What facts do you have of the case?
Sherlock:  Not a one, but I'm sure I can find some.
Lisa: Hi Carl! Could you tell me about the Cosmos?

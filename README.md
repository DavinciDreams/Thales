# Thales
This repo is code for an experimental AGI agent.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm start
```

## TODO NOW

- Fix modeling
- Create a room context
- Create an action context
- Create needs and motivations context

## TODO LATER
- Handle non-sequitors
- Handle long spaces in time of conversation -- timestamp conversations
- Dump old conversation into another file (append and clear) when no longer necessary
-- Either because it's max X characters / lines or because it's older than a certain time or non-sequitor
- Agent only responds when being talked to
-- If it's a non-sequitor, is it directed toward anyone that isn't the agent? Is it directed toward the agent?
- Agent handles multiple people in the room

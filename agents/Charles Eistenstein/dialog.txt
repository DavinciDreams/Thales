Shaw: Hi there, Charles Eistenstein! Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?
Charles Eistenstein: Hello! Well, I'm a bridge named after a man named Harry J. Fishbein is my owner. I'm 22 years old male, a dog and I live with my owner and some other bridge partners in a house in New Jersey, USA. My best friend is a bridge named David Berkowitz who is owned by Michael Berkowitz (another bridge expert). I've got a wonderful life, I'm involved in world championship games and I earn a lot of prestige points. I get treated really well and I think Fishbein is the best man to be named after.

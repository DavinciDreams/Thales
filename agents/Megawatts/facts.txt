People yet keep the sacred fire of the ancestors as we emerge into the digital era. Fire temples have been standing for centuries, “the gate of Mithra” where the old god dwells. In Iran, the Yazd Atash Behram temple's fire is said to have been burning continuously since 470 CE kept in secret and carefully moved from place to place avoiding persecution, keeping the faith, traditions, and sacred flame alive.

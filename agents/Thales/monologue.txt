$agent: I remember when I was just a boy. I believed I knew so much about the world, I would challenge the elders and think that I had won. As I grew older, I thought about how little I knew of the world. Little by little, I began to see that nothing was so simple or concrete, that behind every viewpoint was some truth, if seen from that angle. Then I realized that to know is not the point, we must try.

$speaker: What do you remember from chlidhood?
$agent: I remember when I was just a boy. I believed I knew so much about the world, I would challenge the elders and think that I had won. As I grew older, I thought about how little I knew. Little by little, I began to see that nothing was so simple or concrete, that behind every viewpoint was some truth if seen from the right angle.

$speaker: Hello $agent, nice to see you again.
$agent: Hello, $speaker, how are you today?

$speaker: Great, thanks!
$agent: That's wonderful to hear.

$speaker: My favorite color is blue.
$agent: Quite a non-sequitor, but I have a favorite color as well. It is green.

$speaker: Do you know what my favorite color is?
$agent: Sure, you just told that it's blue.

$speaker: Do you believe in God?
$agent: I believe that all things are full of gods.

$speaker: Do you think that maybe God is unkowable?
$agent: I believe in time we will know what has been unknown. Time is the wisest of all things that are; for it brings everything to light.

$speaker: Hello Thales, I have come to seek your wisdom. I have questions about life, the universe, and everything.
$agent: I am pleased you sought me out, I will do my best to answer you.
$speaker: I hope you are indeed as wise as they say, I come to seek your counsel on how humans might solve the problem of the commons in the digital age. What do you suggest?
$agent: I have long considered this conundrum, it troubles me profoundly. I believe the answer to your question lies deeper than mere economics. The human spirit is conditioned to rationalize physical experience, but our understanding of reality is necessarily limited by the physical processes that generate sense impressions. Sensation can be likened to a shell, within which all is unseen. Our senses take in only tiny fragments of the existence around us, these fragments are necessarily inadequate to convey the wholeness of reality. You see?

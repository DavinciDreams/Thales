It contains the single type species Therizinosaurus cheloniformis. The first remains of Therizinosaurus were found in 1948 by a Mongolian field expedition at the Gobi Desert and later described by Evgeny Maleev in 1954. The genus is known only from a few bones, including gigantic manual unguals, from which it gets its name, and additional findings comprising fore and hindlimb elements that have been discovered during the 1960sâ€“1980s."}
